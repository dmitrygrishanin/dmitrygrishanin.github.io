  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> June 10, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Clean Content</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") operates a mobile and web application that analyzes Instagram comments for your Instagram account. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Instagram Account Data:</strong> With your explicit authorization, we may collect basic information such as your Instagram username and user ID to analyze comments.</li>
    <li><strong>Comments and Interaction Data:</strong> We may access comments and related interaction data solely for providing moderation and analytics features.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical and Device Information:</strong> We may collect information such as IP address, device model, operating system, app version, and browser type to ensure app performance and security.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> We may use privacy-friendly analytics tools (for example, Apple App Analytics or Firebase) to understand general usage trends. These tools do not identify individual users.</li>
    <li><strong>Support Information:</strong> If you contact us, we may collect your email address and message content to provide assistance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide the app’s main functionality — analyzing and moderating Instagram comments.</li>
    <li>To maintain, secure, and improve our services and performance.</li>
    <li>To communicate with you regarding support or technical issues.</li>
    <li>To comply with legal and platform (Apple, Meta) requirements.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We <strong>do not sell, rent, or share</strong> your data with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your data is stored securely and protected with encryption and access controls.</li>
    <li>Access to your information is restricted to essential app functions and authorized personnel only.</li>
    <li>We retain data only as long as necessary to provide the app’s services.</li>
    <li>You can revoke Instagram access at any time via your Instagram settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Our app uses the <strong>Instagram Graph API</strong> to access and analyze comments. Your use of Instagram is governed by Instagram’s own <a href="https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
  <p>We may also use secure third-party platforms for hosting, analytics, or error tracking (for example, Heroku, Firebase). These services handle data in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your data.</li>
    <li>You may withdraw your consent or request complete data removal at any time.</li>
