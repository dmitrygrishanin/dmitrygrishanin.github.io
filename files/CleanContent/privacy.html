  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>CleanContent does not store or share any user data obtained from Meta platforms. We use the Instagram Graph API to access comment data only for the authorized account and only to enable moderation actions directly within the app.</p>

  <p>Users may revoke access at any time via their Instagram account settings.</p>

  <h2>Data Usage</h2>
  <p>We only request permissions necessary to provide moderation functionality, such as <code>instagram_business_basic</code> and <code>instagram_business_manage_comments</code>. These are used to fetch business account info and manage comments, respectively.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>All interactions with Meta APIs are encrypted and authenticated. No data is shared with third parties.</p>
